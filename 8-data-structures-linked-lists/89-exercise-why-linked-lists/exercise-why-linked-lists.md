# Why do you think linked lists may be better than hash tables or arrays?
* Ordered data unlike hash tables
* Can probably just change where the node points to, so when inserting or deleting a node you can just change where a node points to or remove a pointer instead of having to shift elements in memory like in an array when inserting or deleting
